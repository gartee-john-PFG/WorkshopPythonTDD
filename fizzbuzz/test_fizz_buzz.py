# from fizz_buzz import *
# think (what code do I want to write?)
# red (use description from above and fail for right reason)
# green (pass test using what we wanted to write above)
# refactor (remove dups, make elegant, etc.)

# Three rules of TDD
# do not touch prod code w/o failing unit test
# only as much of a unit test as it takes to fail
# only as much prod code to make this one test pass

# Hints:
# Look for easy transforms and test THEM
# Focus on the easiest transforms
# commit after green
# don't skip refactoring
# commit after refactor
